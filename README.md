<!-- before start of project-->
Recipe Project for The Odin Project. Plan making a Scrambled Egg recipe that I use every morning, before I start studying.

<!--after finishing project -->
Turns out there are 2 more recipes I have to include, so I added Cowboy Casserole and Beef Stroganoff.
These dishes are something I'd like to try and attempt in the future and use the recipes that I provided in the files.
