        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This one-pot ground beef stroganoff is <em>creamy</em> and <em>delicious</em>! My family loved the boxed version of ground beef stroganoff, 
                but we have done away with processed foods. I created this out of necessity, and they don't miss the box at all!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                    <li>1 ¾ cups milk</li>
                    <li>1 ¼ cups beef stock</li>
                    <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
                    <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
                    <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain.</li>
                    <li>Combine cornstarch, salt, parsley, garlic powder, and onion powder in a small bowl.</li>
                    <li>Pour cornstarch mixture, milk, beef stock, and egg noodles into the skillet; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer, 
                        stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream and Parmesan cheese until just combined.</li>
                </ol>
