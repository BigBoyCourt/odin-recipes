        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These <em>delicious</em> scrambled eggs are meticulously stirred on and
                off a medium heat for roughly 5-8 minutes, being very thorough of the stirring and scrapping
                all the edges of the pan. This recipe is all about making sure the pan doesn't get too hot. Taking your pan on and off the heat every couple
                of minutes and the continuous stirring is what makes these eggs <strong>perfect</strong>!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Two eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp of salted butter</li>
                <li>1 tsp of salt and black pepper (added before the last round of off heat)</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp of a type of cream (sour cream in this recipe, added after eggs are cooked)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp of Buttery and Garlic herb seasoning</li>
                <li>Perfectly toasted piece of bread (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Crack eggs and put cold butter into an <strong>UNHEATED</strong> pan</li>
                <li>Turn stove on medium heat and continuously stir until pan starts to get warm</li>
                <li>Once pan is warm, take the pan off the heat and continue to stir and scrap the sides. <em>(Repeat on and off heat until eggs are almost cooked, still wet)</em></li>
                <li>Add the 1 tsp of salt and pepper and continue to stir off and on heat until the eggs are cooked</li>
                <li>Once the eggs are cooked, take the pan off the heat and add 1 tbsp of cream, stir, then add 1 tbsp of buttery and garlic herb seasoning on the eggs</li>
            </ol>
